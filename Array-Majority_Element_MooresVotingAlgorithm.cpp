//Example:
// You're in a room with people supporting different candidates. Every time you see a person supporting someone different from your current favorite, 
// you cancel them out â€” one supporter from each side walks out.The person with the most support will remain by the end.


// If an element appears more than half the time, then:
// 1.The count of that element is greater than the sum of all other elements combined.
// 2.So, any "cancellation" you do between the majority and minority elements will still leave the majority element standing.
